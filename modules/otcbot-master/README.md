# LuniaBot
A bot that provides all the basic bot features, it currently contains: waypoints with loading and saving, autotargetting, auto healing, auto haste, auto mana shield, mana training. I guess the only major thing missing is auto loot, and once that's done this bot should be fine for cavebotting.

# Install
To install simply clone the repo to otclient/mods folder.

# Etc
All settings are automatically saved and stored inside your otclient config, and each character got their own config, the settings will automatically load when you log onto a character. You can also save and load waypoints, they will be stored inside otclient/modules/otcbot-master/wpts.

The code is quite messy, I just wanted to put it out there quickly, feel free to improve it - I will probably try and make it a lot cleaner once I got some time over!
